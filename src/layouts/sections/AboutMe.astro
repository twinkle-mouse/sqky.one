        <p>hi! i'm <em>Stella</em>, you can also call me <em>twinkle</em> or <em>mouse</em>.</p>
        <p>
            the name <em>twinkle</em> actually came from <strong>Twilight Sparkle</strong>,,,,,,, i used to go by <em>Twinkle Sprinkle</em> before i dropped the
            <em>Sprinkle</em> and made the Twinkle <strong>lowercase</strong> &lt;:
        </p>
        <p>i'm very silly and <strong>gay</strong>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

        <br />

        <p>we were born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan">Taiwan</a> <small>please don't come at me about relations with mainland,</small></p>
        <p>we grew up in Taiwan, and we still speak <em>Mandarin</em> fluently! <small>(and a bit of <em>Hokkien</em> but like,)</small></p>
        <p>we had actually never been to any other countries before moving out of Taiwan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
        <p>
            we learned how to speak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">English</a> by being terminally online and socially isolated IRL and
            bullied constantly at school (:
        </p>
        <p>we moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">Spain</a> in <code>late 2024</code>!!!</p>

        <br />

        <p>we play a lot of <em>videogames</em>!!!!</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Lavvie</strong> particularly loves to play fast-paced games like <em>Dead Cells</em>, <em>Hollow Knight</em>, <em>ULTRAKILL</em>, and also
            just games that require a lot of mechanics like <em>Noita</em> and <em>Neon White</em> :3
        </p>
        <p>
            i particularly loves games that are a superposition of stupid and brain-wracking / nerve-wracking, like
            <em>Modded Minecraft</em>, <em>Modded Terraria</em>, (Modded) <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>, (Modded) <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>,
            <em>Cobalt Core</em> and <em>Balatro</em>,
        </p>
        <p>
            we've also played a lot of Nintendo games in the past, though we don't any more because the new games are <strong>mid</strong> and the company is
            <strong>ass</strong>!!!!!
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>we also <em>code</em> a lot!!!!</p>

        <p>including this very website :&gt;</p>
        <p>we also work on a videogame!!!!! it's called <a href="https://github.com/automancy/automancy"><i>automancy!</i></a>, it's an automation game :3</p>
        <p><small>(it's partially inspired by our love/hate relationship with <em>Gregtech</em>, a Minecraft mod)</small></p>
        <p>we know a few programming languages!!! we like <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><i>Rust</i></a> the most though :3</p>

        <br />

        <p>we also <em>draw</em> sometimes!!!! though we're bad at it</p>
        <p>we also really want to make <em>music</em> some day, though that's far away still,</p>
        <p>we also used to do <em>graphics design</em> for a hobby!!!! :]</p>
