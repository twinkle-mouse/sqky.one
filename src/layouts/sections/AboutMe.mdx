## introduce yourself to the class would u

hi! i'm **Stella**, you can also call me _twinkle_ or _mouse_.
the name _twinkle_ actually came from **Twilight Sparkle**,,,,,,,
i used to go by _Twinkle Sprinkle_ before i dropped the _Sprinkle_ and made the _Twinkle_ lowercase \<:

i'm very **silly** and **gay** 🏳️‍🌈 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i'm also [<i>plural</i>](https://morethanone.info/), more on that later!!! you'll see me say _"we"_ instead of _"i"_, _"us"_ instead of _"me"_ sometimes!!

we were born in [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan) 🇹🇼 <small>(please don't come at me about relations with mainland,)</small>
we _grew up_ in Taiwan, and we still speak [Mandarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese) fluently! <small>(and a bit of [<i>Hokkien</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkien) but like,)</small>

we had actually never been to any other countries before moving out of Taiwan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
we learned how to speak [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) by being terminally online and socially isolated IRL and bullied constantly at school (:

and lastly, we moved to [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain) 🇪🇸 in late 2024!!!

we play a lot of _videogames_!!!!
**Lavvie** particularly loves to play fast-paced games like [Dead Cells](https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/), [Hollow Knight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/), [ULTRAKILL](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/), and also just games that require a lot of mechanics like [Noita](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/) and [Neon White](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1533420/Neon_White/) :3

i particularly loves games that are a superposition of _stupid_ and _brain-wracking/nerve-wracking_, like:

- [Modded Minecraft](https://minecraft.wiki/)
- [Modded Terraria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/)
- (Modded) [Risk of Rain 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/)
- (Modded) [The Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/)
- [Cobalt Core](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2179850/Cobalt_Core/)
- [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/)

we've also played a lot of Nintendo games in the past, though we don't any more because the new games are _mid_ and the company is _ass_!!!!!

<p>
    we also **code** a lot!!!! including this very website :>
    we also work on a videogame!!!!! it's called [<i>automancy!</i>](https://github.com/automancy/automancy), it's an automation game :>
    <small>(it's partially inspired by our love/hate relationship with _Gregtech_, a Minecraft mod)</small>
</p>

we know a few programming languages!!!
we like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) the most though, 🦀

we also **write**!!! we really enjoy writing actually, it's really fun to write :>
you should check out [The Library of Squeaks](https://writing.sqky.one)!!! 🖋️

we also **draw** sometimes!!!! though we're bad at it,
practice makes perfect so maybe one day we'll have a page with our art,

we also really want to make **music** some day, though that's far away still,

we also used to do **graphics design** for a hobby!!!! :\]

### what art thee

there's a lot of things i could be… here's a list of ideas for me

<small>
    (this list is ever-growing. we have <abbr>BPD</abbr> (Borderline Personality Disorder) and my identity is as fragmented as my <abbr>HDD</abbr> (Hard Disk Drive))
</small>

- Mouse (mouse (mouse))
- Mouse Plush (that goes 'squeak! 🩷' when you hug it)
- Computer mouse (but also animal mouse (also has RGB gamer lighting))
- Marshmallow mouse (you will be TF'd if you eat me)
- Deer mouse (like a deer if it was small and squeaky and also mouse)
- Mouse girl (girl (young (did you know i'm an age regressor)))
- Mouse Woman (Grown Up (This is Getting Silly))
- (some secret final thing i can't think of)
